                          <p>Text and image compression is required as uncompressed data can take up a lot of space. Text and image files can be compressed to make them smaller and faster to send, and unzipping files on devices has a low overhead.
                            <br>Used Python to first calculate the frequency of each character in a text file. Using Priority Queue, the characters were arranged in a binary tree. Using Greedy algorithms, codes were assigned to each character and thus files were compressed. For de-compression, start from the root node of the Huffman Tree, go left at 0 and right at 1. This way, characters can be obtained back from the encoded codewords.
                            <br>For, frequency of R,G,B channels in each pixel was calculated. The frequency of each colour was obtained from this and from this step the same process for file was followed.
